#variables are used to storing data.
#variables are container for storing data.
#for example :- In kitchen, we have containers for storing daal,rice and other things
#similarly variables are also used for storing data
#rules to make variable:
#1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#2. A variable name cannot start with a number
#3. A variable name can only contain aplha-numeric character and underscores
#4. Variable names are case-sensitive. for ex.:- name and Name they are two different variable
# name and Name
#let's create a variable
a = 5 # a stores integer 5
b = 8 # b stores integer 8
c = a+b 
print(c)
name = 'gungun' # name stores gungun as string and note that string always written under quotes. two types of quotes:- single'' or double""
classs = "CSE" # double quote works similar as single quote
# note that (class) is keyword so we can't create class name variable, you can write Class ,classs
d= 2.5 # d stores float number
