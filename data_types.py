#data type means type of data 
#Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
#there are many types of data types in python :-
#integer,string,boolean,float,complex,list,tuple,dict,set,frozenset,range,bytes,bytearray,memoryview,nonetype
#note:- In python, there is no need to declare data type with variable
#let's take an example of integer data type
#integer data type also called int
#int stores whole number 
a = 5 # a stores 5 int 
print(a)
# To know which type of data stores in variable?
# So we can use type() 
print(type(a))
#let's take an example of String 
# String data type also called str
#string is collection of characters
b ='Hello'
print(b)
print(type(b))
#let's take an example of float
#float stores decimal number or point number
c = 20.5
print(c)
print(type(c))
#let's take an example of complex
#complex stores alpha-numeric data
d = 'hello1'
print(d)
print(type(d))
